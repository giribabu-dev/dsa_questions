/* 
    Sum of Two Integers
    
    Problem Statement::
    Write a Program that defines a function to calculate the sum of two integers and prints the result.
    Call this function by passing two integer values.

    Approach::
    1) Define a function that takes two numbers as input.
    2) Add the two numbers inside the function.
    3) Call the function with two integers & print the result.

    Example::
    1) Input: 5, 3
    2) Process: a + b => 5 + 3 = 8
    3) Output: 8
*/

function sum(a, b){
    let add = a + b;
    console.log(add)
}

sum(5, 3)
