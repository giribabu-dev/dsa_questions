Square of a Number

Problem Statement:
*******************
Write a function that takes an integer and returns its square. Call this function and prints the result.
Square(x) is a function that computes the square of a number. It returns the result instead of printing it.


Example:
*********
Input: 3
Process: square(3) = 3 x 3 = 9
Output: The square is: 9


Approach:
**********
1. Define a function that takes one integer as input.
2. Compute the square of the number (multiply it by itself).
3. Return the result from the function.
4. Call the function and print the returned value.
