/* 
    Check Voting Eligibility

    Problem Statement::
    Write a program that accepts a number (age) and checks whether the person is eligible to vote. A person is eligible if their age is
    18 or more.

    Example::
    Input: 20
    Process: Check if 20 >= 18 â†’ Eligible
    Output: You are eligible to vote

    Approach::
    1) Take input from the user (or define a variable).
    2) Use a conditional statement to check if age is 18 or above.
    3) If yes, print "You are eligible to vote."
    4) Otherwise, print "You are not eligible to vote."
*/

let age = 26;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log('You are eligible to vote.')
}
else {
    console.log('You are not eligible to vote.')
}
