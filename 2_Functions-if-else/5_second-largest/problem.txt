Find the Second Largest Number is an Array


Problem Statement:
Write a function secondLargest(arr) that returns the second largest distinct number in an array.


Requirements:
**************
1. The array must contain at least two elements.
2. If all elements are equal, return: No second largest found.
3. If the array has fewer than two elements, return: Array should have at least two numbers.


Examples:
**********
Input: arr = [0, 3, 5, 2, 7, 9] → Output: 7
Input: arr = [4, 4, 4, 4] → Output: No second largest found
Input: arr = [5] → Output: Array should have at least two numbers
Input: arr = [10, 20] → Output: 10


Constraints:
*************
1. Time Complexity: O(n) -- Single pass through the array.
2. Space Complexity: O(1) -- Constant space.


Approach:
**********
1. Check array length. If fewer than 2 elements, return appropriate message.
2. Use two variables: firstLargest and secondLargest.
3. Ignore duplicates by checking num !== firstLargest before assigning secondLargest.
