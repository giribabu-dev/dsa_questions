Linear Search

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm used to find a specific element in an array.
It checks each element of the array one by one until the target value is found or the end of the array is reached.


Examples:
**********
Example 1:
Input: arr = [2, 4, 7, 10],  target = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 10 is found at index 3

Example 2:
Input: arr = [6, 8, 0, 3],  target = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 5 is not present in the array


Approach:
**********
1. Start from the first element of the array
2. Compare the current element with the target value
3. If a match is found, return the index
4. If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1


Time Complexity (TC):
***********************
1. In the worst case, the algorithm traverses the entire array
2. Each element is checked exactly once
3. TC = O(n), where n is the size of the array


Space Complexity (SC):
************************
1. The algorithm does not use any extra space
2. SC = O(1) (constant space)


Dry Run:
*********
arr = [4, 5, 1, 3, 9]

target = 5

i=0;  0 < 5  => true  => 4 === 5  => false

i=1;  1 < 5  => true  => 5 === 5  => true

result = 1
