Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the 
wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.
After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array.
It's called "Bubble Sort" because smaller elements slowly "bubble" to the top of the list.
