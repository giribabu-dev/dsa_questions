Find Smallest Number in an Array

Problem Statement:
*******************
Write a function that returns the smallest number in an array.


Approach:
**********
1. Initialize a variable smallest to Infinity
2. Loop through the array.
3. If the current element is less than smallest, update smallest
4. Return smallest after the loop ends.


Example:
*********
Input: arr = [2, -6, 4, 8, 1, -9]
Output: -9


Time & Space Complexity:
*************************
1. Time Complexity: O(n) -- where n is the number of elements in the array.
2. Space Complexity: O(1) -- Only a single variable is used.
