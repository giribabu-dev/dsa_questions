Pattern 9: Print an Inverted Right-Angled Triangle of Stars

Write a program that print an inverted right-angled triangle of stars, starting with n stars in the first row and decreasing by one star each row 
until only one star remains.

Output:
* * * *

Approach:
1. Outer loop (Rows): Loop i from 0 to n-1. Each iteration represents a new row
2. Inner loop (Stars): For each row, print n-i stars
3. Print Row: Combine the stars into a string and print it

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2) - because for each row, we may print up to n stars and the total number of stars prints forms a triangular
    number proportional to n^2
2. Space Complexity: O(n) - for storing the row string before printing
