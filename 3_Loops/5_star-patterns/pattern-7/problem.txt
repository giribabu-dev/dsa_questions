Pattern 7: Print a Right-Angled Triangle of Alternating 1s and 0s

Write a program that prints a triangle of alternating 1s and 0s starting with 1 on each row.

Output:
1
1 0
1 0 1
1 0 1 0

Approach:
1. Outer loop (Rows): Loop i from 0 to n-1
2. Initialize toggle = 1: Start each row toggle = 1
3. Inner loop (Columns): For each row, loop j from 0 to i. 
    On each iteration: 
    a. Append toggle to the row string.
    b. Flip toggle between 1 and 0.
4. Print Row: After inner loop, print the row string.

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2)
2. Space Complexity: O(n) per row
