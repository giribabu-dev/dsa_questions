Pattern 5: Print a Reverse Right-Angled Triangle of Increasing Numbers

Write a program that prints a reverse right-angled triangle where each row starts from 1 and the number of elements decreases with each row.

Output:
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1

Approach:
1. Outer loop (Rows): Loop i from 0 to n-1. Each iteration represents a row.
2. Inner loop (Print Numbers): For each row, loop j from 0 to n-i-1 and append j+1 to a row string.
3. Print Row: After the inner loop, print the row string.

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2)
2. Space Complexity: O(n) for the temporary row string.
