Pattern 1: Print nxn Star Square

Print a square pattern of stars (*) of size n x n.


Output:
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *

Approach:
1. Outer Loop (Rows): Run from i=0 to i=n-1
2. Inner Loop (Columns): For each row, loop from j=0 to j=n-1
3. Build Row String: Append * in each inner loop iteration.
4. Print Row: After the inner loop, print the complete row string.

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2)
2. Space Complexity: O(n) (temporary row string)
