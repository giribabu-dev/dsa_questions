Pattern 2: Right Angled Star Triangle

Print a right-angled triangle of stars with n rows.

Output:
*
* *
* * *
* * * *

Approach:
1. Outer Loop (Rows): Run a loop from i=0 to i=n-1. Each iteration represents, one row.
2. Inner Loop (Stars per Row): For each row i run another loop from j=0 to j=i and append a * character to a string.
3. Print Row: Print the string after the inner loop, completes for each row.

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2) because the total number of stars printed is 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2.
2. Space Complexity: O(n) for the temporary string variable storing each row.
