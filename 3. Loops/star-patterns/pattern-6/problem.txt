Pattern 6: Print a Right-Aligned Right-Angled Triangle of Stars

Write a program that prints a right-aligned triangle of stars increasing row by row, with leading spaces for alignment.

Output:
      *
    * *
  * * *
* * * *

Approach:
1. Outer loop (Rows): Loop i=0 from 0 to n-1. Each iteration is a new row.
2. Inner loop 1 (Spaces): For each row, add n-i-1 spaces before the stars to right-align the triangle.
3. Inner loop 2 (Stars): Add i+1 stars after the spaces.
4. Print Row: Combine the spaces and stars, then print the row.

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2)
2. Space Complexity: O(n) for the row string.
