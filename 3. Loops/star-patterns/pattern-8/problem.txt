Pattern 8: Right-Angled Triangle of Alternating 1s and 0s (Global Toggle)

Write a program to print a triangle of alternating 1s and 0s, but the toggle continues globally across rows.

Output:
1
0 1
0 1 0
1 0 1 0

Approach:
1. Global Toggle Variable: Declare toggle=1 before the outer loop
2. Outer Loop: Loop i from 0 to n-1
3. Inner Loop: Loop j from 0 to i
    On each iteration:
    a. Append: toggle to the row string
    b. Flip: toggle 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1
4. Print the Row: after the inner loop

Key Difference:
1. In the previous pattern, toggle=1 was reset each row. Here, the toggle continues globally across the entire pattern

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2)
2. Space Complexity: O(n) per row
