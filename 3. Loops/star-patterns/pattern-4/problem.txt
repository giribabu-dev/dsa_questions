Pattern 4: Print a Right-Angled Triangle of Repeated Numbers

Write a program that prints a right-angled triangle where each row contains the same number repeated.

Output:
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4

Approach:
1. Outer Loop (Rows): Loop from i=0 to i<n.
2. Inner Loop (Numbers): Loop from j=0 to j<=i, appending i+1 as a string.
3. Build and Print: Build the row string and print it.

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2)
2. Space Complexity: O(n) for the temporary row string.
