Pattern 3: Print a Right-Angled Number Triangle

Write a program that prints a right-angled triangle of numbers of height n.

Output:
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4

Approach:
1. Outer Loop (Rows): Run a loop from i=0 to i<n. Each iteration represents a new row.
2. Inner Loop (Numbers): Run an inner loop from j=0 to j<=i and append j+1 to the row.
3. Build and Print: Construct a string for the row and print it after the inner loop ends.

Time & Space Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: O(n^2) Each row can have up to n numbers.
2. Space Complexity: O(n) Temporary string to build each row.
