Count Negative Numbers in an Array

Problem Statement:
*******************
Write a function that returns the number of negative numbers in an array.


Approach:
**********
1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Loop through the array.
3. If the element is less than 0, increment the counter.
4. Return the final count after the loop ends.


Examples:
**********
Input: arr = [2, -6, 4, 8, 1, -9]
Output: 2


Time & Space Complexity:
*************************
1. Time Complexity: O(n) -- where n is the number of elements in the array.
2. Space Complexity: O(1) -- Only a counter variable is used.
