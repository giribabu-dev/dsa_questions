Missing Number


Approach: (Optimal using Sum Formula)
**********
The Sum of numbers from 0 to n is given by the formula:
    total_sum = (n x (n + 1)) / 2

Steps:
******
1. Calculate total_sum using formula above
2. Calculate the sum of all elements in the input array
3. The missing number is total_sum - sum_of_array


Time Complexity:
*****************
1. Time Complexity = O(n)
2. We traverse the array once to compute the sum.


Space Complexity:
******************
1. Space Complexity = O(1)
2. Only a few variables are used, no extra space proportional to input size.


Dry Run:
*********
nums = [3, 0, 1]

n = 3

total_sum = (3 * (3 + 1)) / 2
          = (3 * 4) / 2
          = 12 / 2
          6

sum_of_array = 3 + 0 1  => 4

result = 6 - 4  => 2
