Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Problem Statement:
*******************
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k. To get accepted, you need to do the following things:
1. Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially.
2. The remaining elements of nums are not important, as well as the size of nums return k.


Examples:
**********
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 2, nums = [1, 2, _]
Explanation: 
1. Your function should return k=2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. 
2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 5, nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, _, _, _, _, _]
Explanation: 
1. Your function should return k=5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.
2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).


Constraints:
*************
1 <= nums.length <= 3*10^4
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


Important Points:
******************
Non-decreasing order:
The array is sorted such that elements can stay the same or increase: nums[i] <= nums[i+1]

Examples:
Valid: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5]
Invalid: [3, 2, 1] (this is decreasing)

In-place:
1. You must modify the given nums array itself.
2. You are not allowed to use extra arrays for storing the result.


Approach:
**********
1. x=0: Pointer to track the last unique element's position.
2. Loop through the array from i=0 to nums.length.
3. If true (new unique value), increment x and update nums[x] = nums[i].
4. This shifts the unique value forward in the array.
5. At the end, x+1 gives the count of unique elements.


Time Complexity:
1. The function uses a single loop that iterates through the entire array once.
2. Each iteration performs constant-time operations (comparisons and assignments).
3. Time Complexity = O(n), where n=nums.length

Space Complexity:
1. The function modifies the array in-place
2. Uses only a few extra variables: x and i
3. Space Complexity = O(1) (constant extra space)


Dry Run:
*********
Input = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5]

k = 0

i = 0, 1>1 => false  [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5]  k=0

i = 1, 1>1 => false  [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5]  k=0

i = 2, 2>1 => true   [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5]  k=1  [1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 5]

i = 3, 3>2 => true   [1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 5]  k=2  [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5]

i = 4, 3>3 => false  [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5]  k=2

i = 5, 5>3 => true   [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5]  k=3  [1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 1]

Result: k=4
Output = [1, 2, 3, 5]
